# Motivation for created REST API

this backend application was created with instructions in the Rocketseat course. This REST API goes communicates with web application.

# Technologies

I used express and sequelize for routes and communication with postgres, the Yup for validation and date-fns for formatation.
Too used mongoose to communication with mongodb and queue-bee to Redis.
The mongodb is responsible by keep notifications and Redis is responsible by send e-mails. The two was used for performance gain.

## Other technologies

Younch, nodemailer, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, multer, sucrase, eslint and prettier.
